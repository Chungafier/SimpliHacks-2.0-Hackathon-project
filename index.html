  <p>The enviroment is slowly dying and the media says that the world may end without you doing X Y Z yet providing no explination as to how to go about this. Yet still, they yell that the world is ending without ever giving an outlet, simply makeing people more frusterated and sad. This website hopes to alleviate some of that seemed helplessness and frusteration at being unable to do tings to stop the very real threat of global warming. I hope to provide you with some motivatinal images to give you a boost to show the earth really is worth saving. As well as a video or two on how to help the enviroment</p>
