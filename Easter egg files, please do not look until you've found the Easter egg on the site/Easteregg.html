  <h1> Hello, you have found the easter egg, it is currently 1:00a.m sunday morning and I am doing the compleat wrong thing right now but here is a secret picture of me that I had planned before I had to sort of restart. the thing that has kept me going is covfefe, good tunes and carrots. And yes, that is actually a picture of my back and all of the alive images of trees are indeed real trees taken from my friend's land.</h1>
  <br>
  <p> I relize that this isn't much of an easter egg considering you'll have/will look through the code anyway and find the files almost imeadatlly anyway but eh, I think that it's pretty cool, but then agian, my opinion isn't really relevent when it comes to judgeing. Yes I sort of copied valve's meet the team video "copywrite LOLOL..." thing.</p> <br> <br>
