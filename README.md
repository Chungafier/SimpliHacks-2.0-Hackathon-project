This is a website with a couple of images of trees, some text and lines, in my opinion it is not the greatest but I worked hard. However, due to me not having
very good time-manegment skills, it is currently 2:13 a.m I was not able to get done all of my hopes and dreams I had for this website however, 
I now am coming away with knowladge for any future hackathons I partisipate in.
This was a very eye-opening experince into the life of a web develper and I hope to do this again next year!
